My long-term research interest focuses on uncovering how disease-associated genetic variants shape gene regulation and phenotype through epigenomic mechanisms. I have developed robust and high-throughput genomic tools to investigate the mammalian epigenome at single-cell resolution, gained interdisciplinary experience spanning both imaging and sequencing, and applied innovative single-cell genomic technologies to study gene regulation in human disease.
