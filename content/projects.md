- Developed Droplet Hi-C, an ultra-high-throughput single-cell Hi-C method that profiles chromatin architecture in up to a million cells per experiment, enabling the construction of the most comprehensive chromatin architecture atlas to date
- Optimized Droplet Paired-Tag, a single-cell multi-omics method that simultaneously profiles histone modifications and gene expression in hundreds of thousands of cells
- Applied Droplet Hi-C and Droplet Paired-Tag in studying human MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis) progression, identifying cell-type-specific chromatin architecture and epigenomic changes
- Applied Droplet Hi-C and Droplet Paired-Tag in studying human heart failure, revealing cell-type-specific chromatin remodeling and gene regulatory changes
